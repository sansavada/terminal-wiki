1. 'options 'contains variable 'memory', 'assembly', 'complier', and 'custom'.

2. THhe error is in 'retur optionsn[-1', which is out of range in the options array. options array have 4 items in
it, which the index should start from 0 to 3. However, the user choice is range from 1 to 4, so to correct it I add
variable 'choice' in the options array 'return options[choice - 1].

3. $1 = 59.

4. Thhe array is an integer arra with three items in it.

5. tTheproblem is that initially 'array' starts with 3 items, but the following line trys to call this array at 23423, which is out of bound for this 'array'.
